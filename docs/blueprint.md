## Core Features:

- Click Interface: A user interface allowing for fast, responsive clicking to register user activity.
- Stats Display: Real-time display of accumulated clicks and claimed tokens.
- Blockchain Integration: Integrate with the Sonic Blockchain to enable token claiming based on accumulated clicks.  This process is initiated through interaction with the smart contract in Sonic.
- Leaderboard Display: Display top users (without ability to modify any external state or permanently modify state).
- Wallet Connection: Connect to user's Phantom, MetaMask, or Nightly wallet using wagmi.sh and viem. This unlocks user functionality to track claimed tokens, and the ability to claim more.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#A020F0), a modern take on Sonic's main hue, radiating energy and modernity, while also providing strong contrast against light backgrounds.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE), offering a clean, neutral backdrop to ensure readability and focus on the interactive elements.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), used sparingly to draw attention to important interactive elements and notifications, complementing the primary purple without overpowering it.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), is modern, readable and objective; this makes it suitable for both headlines and body text
- Crisp, minimalist icons that reflect a digital aesthetic.
- Clean and modern layout with a central focus on the click interface. Important stats are clearly visible without overwhelming the user.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback on user interactions, enhancing the feeling of responsiveness without being distracting.
